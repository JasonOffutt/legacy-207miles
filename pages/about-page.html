<p class="section">1Mission is an international non-profit organization partnering with communities to overcome poverty through a combination of immediate relief and sustainable development. Since 2007 1Mission has: Hosted more than 4,000 volunteers on weekend trips. Mobilized locals to serve more than 25,000 hours in their own communities. Built around 110 houses. A group of private donors pay for the everyday costs of running 1Mission. That means that if you give one dollar, exactly one dollar goes to where it's needed most. Our U.S. based staff, our office, even pens, staples, and credit card transaction fees are sponsored so 100% of your money goes straight to our projects in the field.</p>

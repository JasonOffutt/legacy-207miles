	<p class="break">The 207 Miles charity ride was launched out of a desire to increase awareness of the poverty so close to home and to raise funds for those fighting it. The ride is a two day, 207 miles, cycling event traveling from Peoria, Arizona to Puerto Pe&ntilde;asco, Mexico. In February 2012 more than 50 riders, with the help of corporate and individual sponsors, will raise around $50,000 to help fight poverty in the barrios of Puerto Pe&ntilde;asco. Join us.</p>
